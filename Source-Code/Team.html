<h2 class="title">The Superus Team</h2>
<p>We're #freshoutofthegame , so there's no one better to help you develop your game plan. Our counselling team has gained admissions in the recent admissions cycle in top-ranked universities, namely, Yale, Oxford, Duke, Vanderbilt, University of Toronto, London School of Economics, UCL, Kings, Vassar, and Depauw, amongst a handful of others. Having gone through the admissions process ourselves, we know that numerous "boutique consellors" can put candidates at a large advantage. We'll do the same, but better and at a fraction of the cost.</p>
